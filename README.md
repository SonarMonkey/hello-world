# hello-world
My first repository on github, and a place to put things that I don't know where else to put. There might be ideas, brainstorming, small projects, or various other things that I decided didn't need seperate repos.

About Me:
I'm not actually a very experienced programmer or developer, but I've recently become interested in compiling custom Android ROM's and Kernels, and I wanted to(and am legally obligated to by the GPL License) share the work I have done with android, especially since the community for my device(the Motorola Droid Razr M, or XT907) isn't very big. I also just really love the idea of github, and want to contribute to it in whatever way I can.
