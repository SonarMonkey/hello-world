# hello-world
My first repository on github, a basic test to figure out what this is all about.

About Me:
I'm not actually a very experienced programmer or developer, but I'm interested in programming and development and want to contribute to the GitHub community. Specific interests of mine include Linux OS's, custom Android ROMs and kernels, p2p networks, information security, and beyond.
