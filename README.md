# hello-world
My first repository on github, and a place to put things that I don't know where else to put. There might be ideas, brainstorming, small projects, or various other things that I decided didn't need seperate repos.

About Me:
I'm not actually a very experienced programmer or developer, but I'm interested in programming and development and want to contribute to the GitHub community. Specific interests of mine include Linux OS's, custom Android ROMs and kernels, p2p networks, information security, and beyond.
